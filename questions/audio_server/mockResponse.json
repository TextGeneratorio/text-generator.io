  "text": "Hi, this is Lee Pinkman, founder of Bitbank.nz. We provide high quality forecasts based on machine learning and live up to date charts and indicators across 70 plus crypto currency markets. Our platform exposes what normally is hard to see, which is what a high frequency trading algorithm would be doing in the markets. But our company was born on an automated trading bot that I wrote and that I needed more visibility into. So we provide our predictions with supporting evidence. One of the features of our algorithm is that it builds supporting evidence based on historical examples so for every prediction we can go in and check why it's predicting what it is and perform it in that way, improve performance. It lets you drill down to see charts for each market and we try and be as transparent as we can so that we can see where our projected buying sell points were over time and where our projections were so that you can build confidence in our predictions. So we provide high frequency live predictions every few seconds. It's about 10 to 20 seconds for each prediction and we're predicting 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes and 2 hours into the future. And what we're predicting is what the weighted trade average will be over those time periods. So currently we don't show the volatility, just where your trade is likely to sit if you executed a trade and then executed another trade in those time periods so that you can see what your expected returns will be if you performed averagely. So we also provide historical accuracy and share our methodology and share our experiments in our testing on our blog so you can see what kind of experiments we're doing with our automated trading systems and what our performance is. We just took the buying sell points as is. We've got an API so you can write bots on top of that platform, both a live feed API for the web and a historical data API so you can create your own custom charts and do your own data science to figure out what price is going to be based on indicators which are also available in our API. So I'll show you the main forecast of the year. We would figure out what's the next upcoming cryptocurrency. So in this view it lets you see all the different cryptocurrency markets. You can click in here to dig in. Importantly it shows you how long ago these forecasts were so they should update every so often and some of them aren't updating. This is maybe because there's not enough trades happening for us to compute our metrics. What our metrics are based more on the actual orders that are executing rather than the order book. We do compute the order book imbalance which is computed by taking the weighted average of the order book and figuring out how far that is to the midpoint which is basically the best buy and best sell, halfway in between those. So if that's positive there's a lot of buys close to the best buy and not so many sells close to the best sell. So there's a lot of upward pressure if this is positive like in the example over here. You can click in and see graphs over time. The point here is a bit of an edge case because it's got such a large spread. You can see exactly what I've seen with weighted trade averages. You can see the order book is positively weighted but we're still predicting what the trades are going to be. The average is pretty lower. We're also computing the weighted trade distance at the midpoint. So that's where the weighted average in the trades is over 30 minutes and the distance from that to the current midpoint in the order book is 75 minutes and 2 minutes. This is weighting the trades by the amount. The weighted trade slope is using logistic regression to create a best fit line that's through the weighted trades over time. Again it's weighting the trades by the volume. So if there's a really large trade the line is going to be more affected by that. So you might look for something that's going up recently but has been crashing and it's just trending out. In this case we've got Bitcoin crash. We've got Bitcoin and Litecoin. So it's trending up. There might be one strategy to get a Bitcoin XMR. So Monero has gone down 1% in the weighted average of the trades but now it's kind of poppering. So we'll see what that looks like. The projections are quite an interesting value add that you won't get anywhere else. These are what our algorithm computes that the weighted trade average will be from the midpoint in the next 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 6 minutes and 2 hours. So these projections get less and less accurate the further you go out but the 5 minute ones will be the best and they'll often show you something's been overbought or oversold. The right bottom shows it's quite powerful. The left bottom shows it's quite simple.",
