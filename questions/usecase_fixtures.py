Here\'s an example:\n\n```html\n<p>This is a paragraph.</p>\n<p>This is another paragraph.</p>\n', 'stop_reason': 'max_length'}, {'generated_text': '$(document).ready(function(){\n  $("p").click(function(){\n    $(this).hide();\n  });\n});\n```\n\nThis code adds a click event listener to all `<p>` elements on the page. When a `<p>` element is clicked, it hides itself using the `hide()` method.\n\nNote: The `$(this)` syntax is used to refer to the element that triggered the event. In this case, `this` refers to the `<p>` element that was clicked.\n', 'stop_reason': 'max_length'}]}, 'c-code-generation': {'title': 'C Code Generator', 'description': 'Text generator - C code generation examples', 'generate_params': {'text': '#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n  printf(', 'number_of_results': 4, 'max_length': 100, 'max_sentences': 0, 'min_probability': 0, 'stop_sequences': [], 'top_p': 0.9, 'top_k': 40, 'temperature': 0.7, 'repetition_penalty': 1, 'seed': 0}, 'results': [{'generated_text': '#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n  printf("Hello, World!\\n");\n  printf("I am a C program.\\n");\n  printf("I am running under Windows.\\n");\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis code prints a simple "Hello, World!" message to the console, followed by a message indicating that the program is a C program running under Windows.\n\n**Compilation and Execution**\n\nTo compile and run this code, you can use the following commands:\n\n```bash', 'stop_reason': 'max_length'}, {'generated_text': '#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n  printf("Hello, World!\\n");\n  printf("This is a test\\n");\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis code uses the `#include` directive to include the standard input/output library (`stdio.h`).
