            <p>Text generator is built on the shoulders of giants - open source contributions, transformers, huggingface and OpenAI GPT</p>
            <p>Our logo is generated by an AI diffusion model.</p>
            <p>TextGenerator is a small startup, our mission is to help bring the cost of intelligence to zero. Right now we offer highly accurate reliable and cost effective text generation, text to speech, embedding and machine learning services</p>
            <h3>Tech Background</h3>
            <p>We offer this service using the latest machine learning/AI research running on Google Cloud hardware
                which has proven itself reliable</p>
            <p>We have our own proprietary generation strategies like max_sentence generation etc to help make text generation easy to use as an end user, as well as custom neural network pre and post processing operations including distillation, compression, quantization and serving optimizations to help speed and reliability.</p>
            <p>The server also has model balancing and optimizing strategies for which model is used for processing, this is tailored to each input based on the individual models perplexity scores, this and model caching helps to extend the capabilities of text generation to a broad amount of tasks with multiple models</p>
